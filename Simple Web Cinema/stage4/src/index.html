            For younger viewers, they might not understand the impact of "Shrek" on the film industry and CGI movies. However, being an older guy, I remember how groundbreaking and amazing the computer animation was when the film debuted. It was head and shoulders better than the few CGI movies that had come out in the previous decade...and it finally gave Pixar a serious run for the money. In addition, the plot was very adult...and the film's appeal was much greater than a typical CGI story. Great animation, great story telling and great voice acting, while the movie isn't quite impressive to see today, it still holds up very well and is well worth your time.
            <br><br>
            I could easily say more but this film has over a thousand reviews....so I'll just end it here!

            My 3 year old and my 8 year old (both sons) and my 12 year old (daughter) were terrified. True it didnâ€™t show any scary fights or other things. My daughter was fine but she found disturbing memes. My sons found that the scene where shrek hits somebody with a sword while knighting them gave my kids nightmares. I recommend just depends on what the parent thinks.
            <br>
            I would say watch it with your kids the first few times. Also not for young kids because they will have nightmares.

            I liked the incidental music very much, especially in the escape from the Dragon scene. I wasn't hugely fond of the pop music featured, but putting that minor quibble aside, this was still an original and funny animated film, that will please any animation lover. The animation is faultless, never stiff, and lovely backgrounds. The script is laugh-out-loud funny with the fairytale characters, Gingerbread Man especially, and Robin Hood. The characters are definitely memorable, and the terrific voice cast brings the film to life. Mike Myers voices the ogre with feeling, but it is Eddie Murphy who steals the film. Though Cameron Diaz is lovely as Fiona, and John Lithgow is delightfully villainous as Lord Farquad, though his villain isn't the most memorable villain ever in an animation. The film sparkles with heart and humour, it is impossible not to like it. In conclusion, look out for it, you'll be glad you did! 9/10 Bethany Cox.
